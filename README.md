This is the `ember` Drupal module I used in [my Drupalcon demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O12qBp1lWUc). It allows you to do live Ember app development on top of a Drupal site. It doesn't have any built-in support for deployment, which would involve packaging up the Ember app within Drupal's static assets.

This is not production-ready software, I'm publishing it because people keep asking for it!
